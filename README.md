## Attribution

This project is based on the original DIY SpaceMouse code by SB-OCR https://github.com/sb-ocr/diy-spacemouse.  
Their foundational work on TLV493D-based 3D navigation made this enhanced version possible.  
This fork expands the functionality with:
- Z-axis pan lock
- Improved orbit/pan separation for Fusion 360
- Updated TLV493D library calls
